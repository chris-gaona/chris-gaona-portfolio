Typically if you're employing comments in your code, you'll only do one comment per function or variable declaration unless something tricky is going on. As for best practices in Javascript, I would definitely schedule a mentor session to talk about that one on one, since I can't really have a conversation with you in this feedback form. Best of luck on your next project, and keep shooting for Exceeds! :)",
