            <img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/chrisgaonaportfolio/images/poc-mammoalert.png" alt="POC Android App">
            <p class="project-text">While I worked at POC Medical Systems, I had the opportunity to learn Android development since my company had just lost its only Android developer. It was a challenging experience to learn a new language on the job as quickly as possible while providing great results. During my time, I worked with 2 other colleagues to develop an Android app that would integrate with the medical device and the API's I had developed.

            <p class="project-text">
                While working at POC Medical Systems, I developed their various API's using Node.js, Express, and Mongodb. These API's were used to store data sent from the medical device through the Android app (see above) to Mongodb. They were also used to retrieve data for the Mongodb Console (see below) and to retrieve specific data for each patient via the patient app (iOS & Android).

            <img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/chrisgaonaportfolio/images/mongo-console.png" alt="Mongodb Console">
            <p class="project-text">Again, at POC Medical Systems, I developed a Mongodb Console using Express/Node.js/Pug to be able to easily extract and manipulate all our data in Mongodb. Users could easily query for data using an easy to use interface that was similar to searching and filtering for the right car. I was responsible for constantly updating the way the interface worked based on user requirements. <span>View a live example <a href="https://review.pocmedsys.com">here</a>.</span>
